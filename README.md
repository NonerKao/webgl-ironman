**Thanks** to [Pastleo](https://ithelp.ithome.com.tw/users/20140099/ironman)'s iThome 2021 ironman series and this repo.  Without the comprehensive tutorial, it wouldn't have been possible for me to pickup computer graphics in such a short sprint.

This year in my ironman [series](https://ithelp.ithome.com.tw/users/20103524/ironman/5183), I will hugely rely on this repo to craft 4D skewb.
